# Cabinet: Weighted Consensus Made Fast

## Cabinet in a Nutshell
Cabinet uses weighted consensus to achieve fast agreement. What sets it apart from Raft?
1. **Smaller quorum sizes** enabled by weighted consensus
2. **Customizable failure thresholds**, allowing the system to potentially tolerate more than half of the nodes failing.
3. **Dynamically adjusted weights** based on node responsiveness, helping the system maintain optimal performance.


## How Cabinet works?
Traditional consensus algorithms (such as Paxos and Raft) use majority quorums, which implicitly makes every node's decision weigh 1.

Cabinet assigns different weights to nodes, where a small group of fast nodes (i.e., cabinet members), can make a decision when their weights exceed the half of total weights, which reduces the size of the physical quorum.

### Example: 7-Node Cluster
Below is a visualization of three configurations in a 7-node setup:

- In **Raft**, all nodes are equal, each with an implicit weight of 1. A decision requires a majority (quorum size = 4). This setup tolerates 3 failures.

- In **Cabinet (t=2)**, a weight scheme (12, 10, ..., 3, 2) allows  fast consensus where the top three weighted nodes (cabinet members) agree (quorum size = 3). It tolerates **a minimum of 2 node failures** (any two among n1, n2, and n3) and **a maximum of 4 node failures** (the 4 lowest-weighted ones).

- In **Cabinet (t=1)**, a more skewed weight scheme (60, 30, ..., 3, 2) allows consensus when just the top two weighted nodes (cabinet members) agree (quorum size = 2). This set of weight scheme tolerates **a minimum of 1 node failure** (either n1 or n2 fails) and **a maximum of 5 node failures** (the 5 lowest-weighted ones).

Please refer to the paper for a more detailed description, including how weights are assigned, how weight schemes are calculated, how weights are dynamically adjusted for optimal performance, and our rigorous proofs of safety and liveness.


## Run Cabinet

### Compile
1. Make sure dependencies are installed. GoLang should have been properly installed with `GOPATH` and `GOROOT`. The GoLang version should be at least `go1.17.6`. In addition, three external packages were used (check out `go.mod`).

2. Download the code and go into the cabinet folder.
3. Build this project by `go build ../cabinet`, run the generated bin file.
4. Run `./cabinet -h` to check out the parameters.

### Key parameters
`n` is the number of nodes in the systems.  
`-t` is the failure threshold; the quorum size is `t+1`, which is the number of cabinet members.  
`-id` is the node ID, which is used to find the node's configuration file in `./config`  
`-pd`: when set to `true`, logs are saved to `./logs`; if `false`, log output is printed to the console.  

Please check `loadCommandLineInputs()` in `parameters.go` for other parameters. If you're not planning to use our TPCC/YCSB workloads, you can ignore the parameters related to these workloads and DBs. 

### Configuration
Configuration files are named as `.conf` in the `config` folder. The columns are `serverID`, `IP`, and `port numbers`.

### Starting the Leader

The leader has an ID of `0`, which means it always occupies the first position in the configuration.

- To start the leader, run: `./cabinet -id=0`. Note that there is only one leader in both Raft and Cabinet.
- The leaderâ€™s IP corresponds to the entry with `ID=0` (first column) in the configuration file.

### Run a Follower

- To start a follower, run: `./cabinet -id=1`. For additional followers, simply use incrementing ID numbers (e.g., `./cabinet -id=2`, `./cabinet -id=3`, etc.).
- To demonstrate Cabinet's weighted consensus, you need at least 5 nodes in the system, which includes one leader and four followers.


## Deployment

* Each server retrieves its IP and port using its serverID from `parameters.go`.
* To test Cabinet locally, set localhost as the IP and use different port numbers.


## Micobenchmark

Cabinet also proposes a benchmark framework tailored for distributed consensus applications, with a special focus on leader-based consensus algorithms (e.g., the Paxos/Raft family). This framework introduces a set of versatile and adaptable interfaces that seamlessly integrate existing benchmarks. In this repository, YCSB and TPC-C are integrated into the benchmark framework.
